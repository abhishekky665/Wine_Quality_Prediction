# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction – OASIS Infobyte Internship (Task-4)

## 🔍 Project Overview
This is my **Task-4 Project** under the **OASIS Infobyte Data Science Internship**.  
The goal of this project is to build a **machine learning model** that predicts the quality of wine based on various chemical properties.

I explored the dataset, performed feature analysis, visualized trends, and implemented multiple classification algorithms to evaluate performance.
